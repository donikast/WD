        <h1>Leonardo da Vinci</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance
            who was
            active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect. While his fame
            initially
            rested on his achievements as a painter, he has also become known for his notebooks, in which he made
            drawings and
            notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and
            palaeontology.
            Leonardo is widely regarded to have been a genius who epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his
            collective
            works comprise a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger
            contemporary
            Michelangelo.</p>

                <h3>Early life (1452–1472)</h3>
                <p>Leonardo da Vinci, properly named Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci ("Leonardo, son of ser Piero from
                    Vinci"), was born
                    on 15 April 1452 in, or close to, the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, Italy 20 miles from Florence. He
                    was born out of
                    wedlock to Piero da Vinci (Ser Piero da Vinci d'Antonio di ser Piero di ser Guido; 1426–1504), a
                    Florentine legal
                    notary, and Caterina di Meo Lippi (c. 1434–1494), from the lower class. It remains uncertain where
                    Leonardo was
                    born; the traditional account, from a local oral tradition recorded by the historian Emanuele
                    Repetti, is that he
                    was born in Anchiano, a country hamlet that would have offered sufficient privacy for the
                    illegitimate birth, though
                    it is still possible he was born in a house in Florence that Ser Piero almost certainly had.
                    Leonardo's parents both
                    married separately the year after his birth.</p>

                    <h3>First Florentine period (1472 – c. 1482)</h3>
                    <p>By 1472, at the age of 20, Leonardo qualified as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke, the guild
                        of artists and
                        doctors of medicine, but even after his father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to
                        Verrocchio was such
                        that he continued to collaborate and live with him. Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a
                        1473 pen-and-ink
                        drawing of the Arno valley (see below). According to Vasari, the young Leonardo was the first to
                        suggest making the
                        Arno river a navigable channel between Florence and Pisa.</p>

                <h2>Science and inventions</h2>
                <p>Leonardo's approach to science was observational: he tried to understand a phenomenon by describing
                    and depicting it
                    in utmost detail and did not emphasise experiments or theoretical explanation. Since he lacked
                    formal education in
                    Latin and mathematics, contemporary scholars mostly ignored Leonardo the scientist, although he did
                    teach himself
                    Latin. His keen observations in many areas were noted, such as when he wrote "Il sole non si muove"
                    ("The Sun does
                    not move").</p>
                <p>In the 1490s he studied mathematics under Luca Pacioli and prepared a series of drawings of regular
                    solids in a
                    skeletal form to be engraved as plates for Pacioli's book Divina proportione, published in 1509.
                    While living in
                    Milan, he studied light from the summit of Monte Rosa. Scientific writings in his notebook on
                    fossils have been
                    considered as influential on early palaeontology.</p>
